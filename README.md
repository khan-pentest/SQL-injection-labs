# SQL-injection-labs
sql injection testing on DVWA using kali linux (manually) and burpsuite (automation)
This repository documents my hands-on learning of SQL Injection vulnerabilities using intentionally vulnerable applications.
All testing was performed in a **controlled lab environment**.
## Lab Environment
- Kali Linux
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- Metasploitable 2
- Burp Suite Community Edition
- ## What I Practiced
- Manual SQL Injection testing
- Request analysis using Burp Suite
- Understanding different SQL Injection behaviors
- Comparing manual and automated approaches
## Disclaimer
This project is strictly for **educational purposes**.
No real-world systems were tested.
